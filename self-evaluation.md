## Self-Evaluation 

How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- So far, I feel ok about arrays. I'd rank myself at about 3/5, mostly because the methods don't all make sense to me yet. Even after researching and playing around with some of them (like `.push` and `.unshift`), I don't understand what their purpose is. 

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- I want to better grasp the different methods before tomorrow. I am planning on stopping into office hours (6pm-7pm) tonight. 

What questions do you have about Arrays?
- My only troubles have been with the methods, like I've mentioned above.
